# üö® WebSocket Connection Leak & Quota Issue Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

You were absolutely correct - **this was NOT a quota limit issue**. The real cause was **WebSocket connection leaks** causing resource exhaustion that manifested as 429 errors.

### The Real Problem

1. **WebSocket Connection Leaks**: Multiple WebSocket connections were accumulating without proper cleanup
2. **Infinite Async Tasks**: Each connection spawned async tasks that kept consuming resources
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Too many concurrent connections overwhelmed the system
4. **Infinite Retry Loops**: File queue manager had unlimited retries that amplified the problem
5. **No Connection Limits**: No maximum connection limits were enforced

### Why It Looked Like Quota Issues

```
2025-06-27 00:16:34,821 - ERROR - ‚ùå embeddingÁîüÊàê„Ç®„É©„Éº („Ç§„É≥„Éá„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ 7): 429 Resource has been exhausted (e.g. check quota).
```

The 429 errors were actually **resource exhaustion from too many WebSocket connections**, not API quota limits. Google's API was rejecting requests because the system was making too many concurrent requests due to connection leaks.

## Technical Analysis

### WebSocket Connection Leaks

#### Upload Progress Manager
- **Problem**: No connection limits or cleanup
- **Impact**: Unlimited connections accumulating over time
- **Resource Usage**: Each connection maintained async tasks

#### Client WebSocket Manager  
- **Problem**: No per-user or total connection limits
- **Impact**: Users could create unlimited connections
- **Resource Usage**: Periodic broadcast tasks for each connection

#### File Queue Manager
- **Problem**: Infinite retry loops with no limits
- **Impact**: Continuous API calls even when failing
- **Resource Usage**: Exponential resource consumption

### Connection Lifecycle Issues

```python
# BEFORE (Problematic)
async def add_websocket_connection(self, websocket):
    connection_id = str(len(self.websocket_connections) + 1)
    self.websocket_connections[connection_id] = websocket  # No limits!
    return connection_id

# AFTER (Fixed)
async def add_websocket_connection(self, websocket):
    # Enforce connection limits
    max_connections = 10
    if len(self.websocket_connections) >= max_connections:
        # Remove oldest connections
        oldest_connections = list(self.websocket_connections.keys())[:5]
        for old_id in oldest_connections:
            await self._cleanup_connection(old_id)
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. WebSocket Connection Management (`fix_websocket_quota_issue.py`)

#### Upload Progress Manager Fixes
- **Connection Limits**: Maximum 10 concurrent connections
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove oldest connections when limit reached
- **Connection Timeout**: Auto-disconnect after 30 minutes
- **Health Monitoring**: Check connection state before sending

#### Client WebSocket Manager Fixes
- **Per-User Limits**: Maximum 3 connections per user
- **Total Limits**: Maximum 20 total connections
- **Stale Connection Cleanup**: Remove inactive connections (1 hour timeout)
- **Broadcast Limits**: Limit total broadcasts to prevent resource exhaustion

#### File Queue Manager Fixes
- **Retry Limits**: Maximum 20 retries instead of unlimited
- **Quota Awareness**: Check quota status before each retry
- **Progressive Backoff**: Exponential backoff with maximum 5-minute delay
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Stop retries when circuit breaker is open

### 2. Resource Management

#### Connection Pooling
```python
# Connection limits enforced
max_connections = 10          # Upload progress
max_per_user = 3             # Client connections per user  
max_total_client = 20        # Total client connections
max_retries = 20             # File queue retries
```

#### Automatic Cleanup
```python
# Timeout-based cleanup
connection_timeout = 30 * 60    # 30 minutes
stale_timeout = 60 * 60        # 1 hour
broadcast_limit = 1000         # Max broadcasts per session
```

#### Health Monitoring
```python
# Connection health checks
if websocket.client_state.DISCONNECTED:
    await self.remove_connection(connection_id)

# Quota status checks
status = quota_manager.get_status()
if status['circuit_state'] == 'open':
    break  # Stop processing
```

## Fix Verification

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Unlimited WebSocket connections
- ‚ùå No connection cleanup
- ‚ùå Infinite retry loops
- ‚ùå Resource exhaustion causing 429 errors
- ‚ùå No quota awareness in retries

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Connection limits enforced (10 upload, 20 client)
- ‚úÖ Automatic connection cleanup
- ‚úÖ Limited retries (20 max) with backoff
- ‚úÖ Quota-aware processing
- ‚úÖ Circuit breaker integration

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Apply the Fix
```bash
cd workmate/Chatbot-backend-main
python fix_websocket_quota_issue.py
```

### 2. Verify the Fix
```bash
python test_websocket_quota_fix.py
```

### 3. Restart the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Normal Operation
- WebSocket connections stay under limits
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections
- Reasonable retry attempts with backoff
- No resource exhaustion

### When Issues Occur
- Connection limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Circuit breaker stops processing when needed
- Graceful degradation instead of infinite loops
- Proper error handling and recovery

## Monitoring

### Connection Monitoring
```bash
# Check WebSocket connection counts
# Upload progress: Should be ‚â§ 10
# Client connections: Should be ‚â§ 20
# Per-user connections: Should be ‚â§ 3
```

### Log Messages to Watch
- `üì° WebSocketÊé•Á∂öËøΩÂä†` - Connection added
- `üö® WebSocketÊé•Á∂öÊï∞‰∏äÈôêÂà∞ÈÅî` - Connection limit reached
- `üßπ WebSocketÊé•Á∂ö„Çí„ÇØ„É™„Ç¢` - Connections cleaned up
- `‚è∞ WebSocketÊé•Á∂ö„Çø„Ç§„É†„Ç¢„Ç¶„Éà` - Connection timeout

### Quota Status
```json
{
  "circuit_state": "closed",
  "total_requests": 150,
  "success_rate": 95.5,
  "quota_errors": 2
}
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Connection Limits
- Upload progress: 10 max connections
- Client WebSocket: 20 total, 3 per user
- Automatic cleanup of excess connections

### 2. Timeout Management
- Connection timeout: 30 minutes
- Stale connection cleanup: 1 hour
- Broadcast session limits: 1000 max

### 3. Retry Management
- Maximum 20 retries per task
- Progressive backoff (1s to 5min)
- Quota status checks before retries

### 4. Resource Monitoring
- Connection count tracking
- Health checks for all connections
- Automatic cleanup of disconnected sockets

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional: Adjust connection limits
WEBSOCKET_MAX_UPLOAD_CONNECTIONS=10
WEBSOCKET_MAX_CLIENT_CONNECTIONS=20
WEBSOCKET_MAX_PER_USER=3
WEBSOCKET_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=1800  # 30 minutes
```

### Code Configuration
```python
# In modules/upload_progress.py
max_connections = 10
connection_timeout = 30 * 60

# In modules/client_websocket_api.py  
max_total = 20
max_per_user = 3
stale_timeout = 60 * 60

# In modules/file_queue_manager.py
max_retries = 20
max_backoff_delay = 300  # 5 minutes
```

## Troubleshooting

### If 429 Errors Still Occur
1. Check WebSocket connection counts in logs
2. Verify connection cleanup is working
3. Monitor quota manager status
4. Check for new connection leaks

### If Connections Seem Stuck
1. Restart the application to clear all connections
2. Check for disconnected sockets not being cleaned up
3. Monitor connection timeout logs

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor connection counts
grep "WebSocketÊé•Á∂ö" logs/app.log | tail -20

# Check quota status
grep "Quota Status" logs/app.log | tail -10

# Monitor cleanup activities  
grep "WebSocketÊé•Á∂ö„Çí„ÇØ„É™„Ç¢" logs/app.log
```
